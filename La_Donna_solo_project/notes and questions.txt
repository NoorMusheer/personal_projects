QUESTIONS FOR PETER: 
* Header on multiple HTML pages? (Jquery didn't work for me.   Maybe js and .innerChild? or learn React?) 
* Is validation grading based on character validation for pw? (ie, must have 8+ characters, upper and lower case) 
* How to do Auto email? does what i have commented out seem okay so far? 
* Should I include measurements as part of the Bride table/Class? or leave it as a separate table? 
	If keep it as a separate table, then how to make sure each bride has only one set of measurements.? validator?
